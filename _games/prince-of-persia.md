## My First Game

This is the first video game that I ever played when I was around 4 years old, in my father's research lab. To make me stay at a place, and not disturb the equipments and PhD students, I was made to sit in from of the pc and introduced to this game. As this beautiful game was introduced to me, and I was subsequently mesmerized by the fluid animations with simple yet challenging gameplay, I hereby introduce the Prince of Persia to you.
